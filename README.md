A flask app for generating Urban Dictionary-sounding phrases

CAUTION: The reader will find much to be offended by in the files 
*.hide.db. They contain some hidden words used to "spice-up" the 
google image search on which this app depends. 

The files *.show.db should be free from any phrases that one might 
be embarrassed to use in certain company.  

The general idea is to randomly combine two phrases (a modifier and 
a noun phrase) that would, individually, be acceptible to your 
grandmother, your six-year-old or both, but when taken together, 
sound slightly pervy. The app then does a Google photo search to 
find, depending on the settings, an more-or-less approriate image
to complement the phrase.

Future work includes a way to allow the user to suggest plausible 
definitions for the displayed phrase and a blog-style comment 
stream. 

The author would like to thank the following contributors to this
effort. B. Ashworth, who keeps suggesting good ideas an then 
adding them. J. Lockman, L. Lam, P. Franz, A. Serenil, 
S. Hwan, J. Miller, L. Goaneh and J. Zimmerman, all my 
immediate office neighbors, who contribute by adding to the word 
databases, suggesting features, forking and compulsively clicking 
the Shuffle button while they should be focusing on work, family
or sleep.

For a good chukle, have a look at favorites.txt for some of this app's 
more fortuitous outcomes.
